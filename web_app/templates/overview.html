        <h5 class="fw-bold">What is Crypto?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-4">Cryptocurrency is a digital and encrypted form of currency. You can use crypto just like you would cash or credit to buy regular things (groceries, clothes, etc.) It does not have a central governing agency (like the fed). However, it's much riskier and requires an understanding of how each type of crypto works.</p>
        
        <h5 class="fw-bold">What is a Blockchain?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-4">A common term you'll hear within the crypto world is "blockchain." A blockchain is similar to a checkbook, it records each transaction on a page, then putting all of that together is a blockchain. Each investor has their own copy and it's updated when a transaction is made.</p>

        <p class="text-muted mb-4">While crytocurrency has become a household term, many people are still hesitant to invest in crypto because of the inherent risks. One of the largest risks in this industry is the cyber risk.
